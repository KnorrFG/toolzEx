toolzEx
=======

I love the library toolz_. And I guess for good reasons, they're keeping their
API small. While it is a great library, I am missing some functionality a lot
of time. There are many other libraries for functional programming, that
contain the functionality that I miss, but I dont want to add 4 libraries to
every project that have an overlap of 80%.

So I went ahead and **stole** my favorite functionality from other
libraries (funcy_, and fn_). This way I now only have to install two libraries.

Also I added a little bit of original code and some aliases. To see what is in
here, just look at the `__init__.py`. But honestly, this is not really intended
for other people, and therefore it is not really documented.
